1.Object casting
Objct obj = new Object();
Circle c = obj; //Error
Circle c = (Circle) obj; //down-casting

2.Object casting
instanceof Circle

3.Abstract classes
interface: common behavior between unrelated classes
abstract

abstract class: can not be instantiated
concrete class: can be instantiated

A sun class can be abstract even if the super class is not.
can not use multimorphism in abstract class, since the abstract class can not hold reference.

4.interface
A class implement an interface

Comparable
public interface Comparable<E> {}

Cloneable
shallow copy 
Object obj1 = obj2;
The same address
code:
public Object clone(){
	return this
}

deep copy
Object obj1 = (Object) obj2.clone();
The differencet address
